    <p>
      I am striving to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and to embrace the
      Web Developer ecosystem. <br />
      Beside <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>jQuery</em>, <em>React</em>,{" "}
      <em>Redux</em>, <em>Nodejs</em>, <em>Express</em>, <em>mongoDB</em>,{" "}
      <em>d3.js</em>, I am also getting my hands on <em>Webpack</em>,{" "}
      <em>Babel</em>, <em>Apollo GraphQL</em>, <em>React-Static</em>,{" "}
      <em>Jest</em> and more... <br />
      I like to collaborate with other developers, to learn and to teach to
      others what I have learnt. My team won the first prize and the Clarifai
      API sponsor prize at the online JAMstack hackathon 2018.
